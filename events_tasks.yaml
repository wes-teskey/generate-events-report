    Verify the accuracy of the information for all events at: 
    
    {venue} 
    
    for the following dates:
    
    {dates_to_check}
    
    Cross-check each piece of information A, B and C with two websites 
    to ensure reliability. 
    For an event to be considered verified, it must have information for 
    each of the below points (A-C) and each piece of this information must be
    verified from two websites. Here is the format to use:

    A. event's name (include the two websites used to verify event's name)
    B. dates (include the two websites used to verify event's dates)
    C. location (include the two websites used to verify event's location)

    If an event is not fully verified (meaning that all points A, B and C are not
    each verified from two websites), do not include it in the summary.

    If no events are found for the venue, write "No events found for this venue."
